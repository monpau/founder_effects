Code to perform simulations to explore the genetic impact of founder effects
and local adaptation in zooplanktonic populations.

Details of the implementation are described in

The program requires the following input parameters:
 [1] Diapausing egg bank (boolean, default TRUE)
 [2] population growth (r) (float)
 [3] carrying capacity (float)
 [4] number of migrants (integer)
 [5] number of founder (integer)
 [6] number of genes under selection (integer)
 [7] number of neutral genes (integer)
 [8] fitness component (float)
 [9] genetic recombination rate (float)
 [10] output file

Other parameters such as length of lake hydroperiod, production, survival and
deterioration dynamics of diapausing eggs can also be modified
